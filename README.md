shellbox is a shell with built-in commands for embedded systems. It has the functionality of a full linux/UNIX shell including fast shell scripting and many standard commands, all within a relatively simple structure which can be easily added to your embedded project.

shellbox is designed for modern embedded systems with >1MB of FLASH and RAM plus a usable filesystem and a fairly complete C library implementation.

shellbox is based on the dash shell, toybox command line utilities and the libedit command line editor.
