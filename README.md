shellbox is a shell with built-in commands for embedded systems. It has the functionality of a full linux/UNIX shell including fast shell scripting and many standard commands, all within a simple structure which can be easily added to your embedded project.

shellbox is derived in part from the dash shell and the toybox command line utilities.
